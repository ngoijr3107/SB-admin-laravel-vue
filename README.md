<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


`laravel-vue-dashboard` is a Single Page Application (SPA) dashboard
built with [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) ([SB Admin Template](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2)). Thanks to the combination of the power of Laravel and the speed of Vue.js it is an excellent full-stack starter kit for enterprise applications.
 
 
It's a kit to start from scratch, not a Laravel package. It can help you to cut down your time by having an SPA dashboard with authentication system ready to use, taking advantage of [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/passport) that uses the oauth2 authentication protocol.
 
The project provides sample pages, uses the routing system of Vue.js and Vuex for maintaining the application state.<br>
The code is structured in such a way to make it easy to modify and add new pages, components and APIs.
